# WeatherStation

This code is used in Chapter 2 of Head First Design Patterns. I've translated it from the books Java examples into a working C# .Net Standard project. This project also has a console app so that you can test the output of the Classes that are created in the examples.

You'll want to run the console app to see the results.

You'll also need to run a NuGet update and add System.Collections.NonGeneric to the reference section of the Project. Without it, the ArrayList type won't show up correctly.
